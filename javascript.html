                <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
                <br>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                JavaScript is extremely popular for a varity of reasons. It is a small and
                lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch
                of differnt directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser
                or Node server), it can be connected to the objecs of these environments to provide
                programmatic control over them.</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers
                    for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds
                    the coffee, a variable holds the value. All JavaScript variables must be identified
                    with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="purpLets">var x;</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values
                    to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                    <span class="purpLets">var x = 10;</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate
                    on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript
                    primitive: Boolean - <span class="purpLets">true</span> or <span class="purpLets">false;</span>
                    null - <span class="purpLets">null</span> aka nothing; Number <span class="purpLets">
                    42</span> or <span class="purpLets">3.14159;</span> String - <span class="purpLets">
                    "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purpLets">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>
                    and Object - <span class="purpLets">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'}</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions
                    for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have
                    have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are
                    the following conditional statements: <span class="purpLets">if</span> a specified condition
                    is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purpLets">else if</span> to specify a
                    new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span class="purpLets">else</span>
                    we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language,
                    but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times.
                    Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                    That's a loop!</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our
                    function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example
                    imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
                    started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way
                    up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call
                    our function over and over again.</li>
